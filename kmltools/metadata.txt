about=
    The native QGIS KML importer creates separate layers for each folder within a KML. If there are hundreds of layers, the import can be very slow or can crash QGIS. This plugin only creates one point layer, one line layer, and one polygon layer. It adds the nested folder structure to a field in the QGIS layer. This makes the KML/KMZ import very quick. An additional tool looks at the KML description field to see if there are two column tables with entries, "tag=value" pairs, or "tag: value" pairs that could be expanded into table fields. It can export point, line, and polygon layers to a KMZ preserving basic styling for simple, categorized and graduated styles. It can also extract ground overlay images and convert them to GeoTIFF images.
