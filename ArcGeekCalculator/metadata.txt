about=Developed by Franz Pucha-Cofrep, 2024-2026. ArcGeek Calculator provides a comprehensive suite of tools for GIS analysis, hydrology, topography, and planning. Includes the new Multiple Basin Delineation tool.

# Key Features - Version 4.0.6

## NEW in Version 4.0.6:
    - Added Multiple Basin Delineation tool (contribution by Anthropocene Engineering team - anthroeng.com)
    - Enhanced Watershed Basin Delineation tool:
        * Longest Flow Path calculation feature (suggested by Antonio López Espinazo)
        * Topological network integration using r.drain
        * Three Strahler order calculations (sthr_original, sthr_extend, sthr_final)
    - Fixed topological issues in stream network merging
    - Minor bug fixes and improvements

## Core Features:
    - Enhanced Image Classification: Advanced machine learning classification with Random Forest, SVM, GMM, and KNN algorithms, including scientific accuracy assessment and comprehensive HTML reports
    - Least Cost Path Finder: Advanced path optimization with multiple optimization levels, flat terrain sensitivity, and support for drainage analysis, hiking trails, and utility corridors
    - Tree Planting Pattern Generator: Generate optimal planting patterns (Triangular/Quincunx, Rectangular/Square, Five of Diamonds) for forestry and agricultural planning

## Geometric and Coordinate Tools:
    1. Calculate Coordinates: Add XY coordinates to point layers, convert to Decimal Degrees, and provide two formats of Degrees Minutes Seconds.
    2. Calculate Line Geometry: Calculate length and azimuth for line features.
    3. Calculate Polygon Geometry: Calculate area and perimeter for polygon features.
    4. Calculate Angles: Calculate internal and external angles at vertices of lines or polygons.
    5. Go to XY: Quickly navigate to specific coordinates on the map and optionally create point markers.

## Point and Line Processing:
    6. Extract Ordered Points from Polygons: Extract and order points from the vertices of input polygons with bi-directional numbering.
    7. Lines to Ordered Points: Convert line features to ordered point features.
    8. Calculate Line from Coordinates and Table: Generate a line and points from starting coordinates and a table of distances and angles.

## Hydrological Analysis:
    9. Stream Network with Order: Generate a stream network with Strahler order.
    10. Multiple Basin Delineation: Delineate multiple basins from points, snap them to streams, and calculate drainage areas.
    11. Watershed Basin Delineation: Delineate watershed basins from a DEM and pour points with main channel extension.
    12. Watershed Morphometric Analysis: Perform a comprehensive morphometric analysis of a watershed, calculating various parameters and providing their interpretations.
    13. Calculate Global Curve Number: Calculate CN values using global datasets for hydrological analysis.

## Terrain and Topographic Analysis:
    14. Topographic Profile: Generate interactive topographic profiles from lines and DEMs with advanced visualization.
    15. Least Cost Path Finder: Advanced path optimization for drainage channels, hiking trails, utility lines, and irrigation planning.

## Land Analysis and Raster Processing:
    16. Land Use Change Detection: Analyze changes in land use between two time periods.
    17. Weighted Sum Analysis: Perform weighted sum analysis on multiple raster layers.
    18. Optimized Parcel Division: Divide rectangular parcels into lots of specified width.
    19. Dam Flood Simulation: Simulate flooding based on a DEM and specified water level.

## Machine Learning and Advanced Analysis:
    20. Enhanced Image Classification: Machine learning classification with scientific accuracy assessment.
    21. Kriging Analysis: Perform spatial interpolation using Kriging (requires external libraries).
    22. Satellite Index Calculator: Calculate various satellite indices (NDVI, NDWI, etc.) for different satellites.

## Forestry and Agricultural Planning:
    23. Tree Planting Pattern Generator: Generate optimal tree planting patterns with comparative density analysis.

## Data Management and Export:
    24. Basemap Manager: Add and manage basemaps from Google Maps, Esri, Bing, and others.
    25. Screen Capture: Capture and georeference the current map view.
    26. Export to CSV: Export vector layer attributes to CSV format compatible with Excel.
    27. Export Contours to 3D CAD: Export contour lines to DXF format preserving elevation values.

## Compatibility:
    - Supports both Qt5 and Qt6 versions of QGIS
    - Compatible with QGIS 3.34 through 3.99
    - Fully tested on QGIS 3.40 (Qt5) and QGIS 3.44 (Qt6)

## External Dependencies:
Some tools require additional Python packages:
- Enhanced Image Classification: scikit-learn, numpy (matplotlib, seaborn for full reports)
- Kriging Analysis: pykrige, scipy
- Topographic Profile: plotly
- Hypsometric Curves: plotly, numpy
